# Roman-Arabic Numeral Converter

This C++ program converts Roman numerals to their corresponding Arabic numbers and vice versa. It reads a file containing either Roman or Arabic numerals, converts them to the other numeral system, and outputs the result to another file.

## Why Use This Program

This program can be useful for anyone who needs to quickly convert between Roman and Arabic numerals. It can save time and reduce the risk of errors compared to manual conversions.

## How It Works

The program reads a file containing either Roman or Arabic numerals. If the input is in Roman numerals, the `RomanToArabic` function is called to convert it to an Arabic number. If the input is in Arabic numerals, the `arabicToRoman` function is called to convert it to a Roman numeral. The converted result is then outputted to another file.

## Skills Demonstrated
